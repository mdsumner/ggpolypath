## ggpolypath 0.2.0

Update to pre-empt upcoming changes to ggplot2 (size->linewidth aesthetic). 

Passes check on upcoming ggplot2 3.4.0 and current CRAN version 3.3.6. 

## revdeps

- venn package passes check
- inlabru author confirms passing check (and other revdep packages 'intSDM', 'PointedSDMs' leverage inlabru so I assume they won't be affected but I can't install these
- RSDA I cannot install myself to check, so have emailed the author

Thanks very much, 

Michael Sumner.
